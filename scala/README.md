## Pillars
There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

## Sum of two lowest positive integers
Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

[10, 343445353, 3453445, 3453545353453] should return 3453455.
